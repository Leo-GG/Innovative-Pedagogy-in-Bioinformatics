# Teaching Python with Team-Based Learning: Cloud-Based Notebooks

This repository contains the Jupyter Notebooks and associated materials for the study "Teaching Python with Team-Based Learning: Using Cloud-Based Notebooks for Interactive Coding Education" by Nuno S. Osorio and Leonardo D. Garma.

## Overview of Notebooks

The study utilized a series of interactive Python notebooks designed to introduce postgraduate biomedical students to Python programming and its applications in bioinformatics. The notebooks were used within a Team-Based Learning (TBL) framework.

Below is a guide to the main instructional notebooks and their roles in the TBL sessions:

1.  **`Introduction_to_Python.ipynb`**
    *   **Purpose:** Covers Python fundamentals.
    *   **Role in TBL:**
        *   Served as **pre-class preparation material** for students to review independently.
        *   Available as an **in-class resource** during the Team Readiness Assurance (TRA) test phase.

2.  **`NB1_Intro_pandas.ipynb`**
    *   **Purpose:** Introduces data manipulation and analysis using the Pandas library.
    *   **Role in TBL:** Served as the **first application notebook** used by student teams during the application case session.

3.  **`NB2_Intro_scanpy.ipynb`**
    *   **Purpose:** Introduces bioinformatics analysis workflows using tools such as AnnData, Scanpy, and Muon for tasks like single-cell data analysis.
    *   **Role in TBL:** Served as the **second application notebook** used by student teams during the application case session, building upon the skills from NB1.

4.  **`NB3_Hands_on_complete.ipynb`** (and/or **`NB3_Hands_on_students.ipynb`**)
    *   **Purpose:** Provides an additional practical example with exercises for further reinforcement of concepts.
    *   **Role in TBL:** Served as an **optional self-study notebook** for post-class practice by students.
